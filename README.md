# PyScript UI Library (uilib)

A Pythonic UI library for building user interfaces with PyScript and Bootstrap 5. This library provides a set of classes to create UI components in a structured and object-oriented way, abstracting away direct DOM manipulation.

This repository serves as a template. It includes the `uilib.py` library and a "kitchen sink" `main.py` example demonstrating many of its features.

## Getting Started

1.  Click the green **"<> Code"** button at the top of this repository's page.
2.  Select **"Download ZIP"**.
3.  Unzip the file on your computer.
4.  You now have a complete project folder. The default application is called `index.html`. Note that due to CORS restrictions you must run ``index.html`` from a server. From your project directory run:

```
pythom -m http.server
```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Usage

You need the following files:
- ``index.html`` - this is the *home page* for you app. You should not have to change ``index.html`` at all unless you need to add additional JS libraries.
- ``main.py`` - this is where your Python application code goes.
- ``pyscript.toml`` - this, amongst other things, is where you must list the Python libraries that you use.

You can publish your application to any static web page (e.g. GitHub Pages).
